## Security practices
Security affects everything we do at Axle. We are currently undergoing our SOC 2 Type 2 audit and we:

* Force HTTPS on all connections, so data in-transit is encrypted with TLS 1.2.
* Encrypt all database data at-rest with AES-256.
* Host all servers in the US, in data centers that are SOC 1, SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certified. Our data centers have round-the-clock security, fully redundant power systems, two-factor authentication and physical audit logs.
* Regularly conduct external penetration tests from third-party vendors.
* Regularly conduct security awareness training sessions with all employees.
* Maintain detailed audit logs of all internal systems.
