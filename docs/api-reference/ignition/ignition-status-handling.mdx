  Ignition session."

Axleâ€™s Ignition session is the main interface that allows your customers to connect to their insurance accounts and authorize access to scoped data from their insurance policies.

Please first review our Quickstart guide and API docs on how to start an Ignition session, if you have not already.

### Ignition Config

Your `POST` request to `/ignition` is configured with the following request
body:
- Optional: `redirectUri` - the URL we'll redirect the user to upon completion, exit, or error outcomes of the Ignition session, defaults to no redirect
- Optional: `webhookUri` - the URL we'll send events to as the user proceeds through the Ignition session, defaults to no webhook events
- Optional: `config` - optional Ignition session configuration, please refer to example for structure and defaults

```bash Request Sample
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.axle.insure/ignition \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-client-id: cli_mZj6YGXhQyQnccN97aXbq' \
  --header 'x-client-secret: RZM-5BErZuChKqycbCS1O' \
  --data '{
  "redirectUri": "https://example.com/insurance/redirect",
  "webhookUri": "https://example.com/insurance/webhook"
  "config": {
    "acceptManual": false,
    "metadata": {
      "driverId": "c3c95031-c57d-475b-a228-07152b7b6dce"
    }
  }
}
```

### Redirect Parameters

On navigation to the `redirectUri` provided, the URI will be appended with the following parameters:

`status`: String
- complete
- exit
- error

Additional parameters (dependent on status, see below)
- `authCode`: String - authorization code that can be exchange for accessToken for scoped access to connected account and/or policy
- `result`: String - "link" (account connection was made and policy is available) OR "manual" (details were entered through manual collection form) 
- `step`: String - the step where the Ignition session was exited
- `message`: String - additional information about the Ignition session error

```text Redirect sample URL
  https://example.com/insurance/redirect?status=complete&authCode=cod_LwPJhgxnjinMEPfGYc-XV&result=linked
```

<Note>
  The `authCode` expires after 10 minutes, so ensure your backend service is exchanging codes through `POST /token/exchange` in real time.
</Note>

#### onCompleted

When the user successfully connects to their carrier account and shares authorized access to a selected policy, OR if `acceptManual` is enabled, when the user submits their policy information and/or documentation through Axle's manual collection form.

```json
{
  "status": "complete",
  "authCode": "<authCode>",
  "result": "link" || "manual"
}
```

#### onExit

When the user opts out of connecting to their carrier account and/or selecting a policy, OR if `acceptManual` is enabled, when the user opts out of sharing the requested policy information and/or documentation.

```json
{
  "status": "exit",
  "step": "<step-name>"
}
```

#### onError

When Axle is unable to retrieve account or policy information from a selected carrier, OR if `acceptManual` is enabled, when Axle is unable to collect policy information and/or documentation from the user.

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "<message-body>"
}
```

<Warning>
  Never send requests from your client to the Axle API. The client should only be used to handle Ignition status through redirect.
</Warning>

### Webhook Events

If an optional `webhookUri` is provided, a `POST` request will be sent to the `webhookUri` with the following body:

```json Example webhook request body
{
  "id": "<webhook_id>",
