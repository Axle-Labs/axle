## API basics

- The Axle API is built on RESTful principles.
- The API operates over HTTPS to ensure the security of data being transferred.
- All requests and responses are sent in JSON.

### Environments

<CodeGroup>

```bash Production
https://api.axle.insure
```

```bash Sandbox
https://sandbox.axle.insure
```

</CodeGroup>

### Authentication

Axle API requests are authenticated using an client-id and client-secret (API key) pairing sent in the request headers.

- x-client-id — unique identifier for client
- x-client-secret — api key for client (sensitive)
- x-destination-client-id — unique identifier for the destination client (optional field used by platform integrations on select endpoints)

<Check>Contact the Axle team to acquire these keys.</Check>

When making API requests, API keys must match the base URL for the intended environment (see above); otherwise, the endpoint will return a `401 Unauthorized`.

### Rate Limiting

In order to keep systems secure and prevent misuse, all Axle API endpoints have protective rate limiting. The limits should not impact any expected use of the service, but if you are experiencing issues, please reach out to to the Axle team.

If rate limiting does occur, instead of the expected response, the endpoint will return `429 Too Many Requests`.

### Null values

Individual fields may return null values when the carrier data source supports the field, but no information is present for the selected Account or Policy.

_Optional_ fields, such as `Policy.coverages["BI"].property` or
`Policy.coverages["UMPD"].deductible` may return `null` or `undefined`

- `null`: The carrier data source supports the field, but no information is present for the selected Account or Policy.
- `undefined`: The carrier data source supports the field, and data is available that specifies that the field
  does not exist on the Account or Policy.

Example Policy:

```json
{
	"...",
	"policyNumber": "123456789",
	"isActive": true,
	"effectiveDate": null, // No information was available from carrier data source
	"expirationDate": "2023-10-22T04:00:00.000Z",
	"address": {
		"addressLine1": "123 Main St.",
		"addressLine2": null,
		"city": "New York",
		"state": "NY",
		"postalCode": "10014",
		"country": "US",
	},
	"coverages": [
		{
			"code": "PD",
			"label": "Property Damage",
			"limitPerAccident": null, // No information was available from carrier data source
			"deductible": undefined, // The carrier data source specifies that there is no deductible present for this coverage
			"property": "prp_83sD63h82bbeu2Dgn"
    	},
		"..."
	],
	"..."
}
```
