## Validations

A validation is an individual check run against a
policy to ensure that it meets a certain requirement. For example, the
`policy-active` validation checks if the policy is currently active and returns `pass` if it is, and `fail` if it is not.
or `concern` if it seems to be expired.

Some validations are more complex, providing additional insight which is not contained on the policy, like `rental-covered-for-collision` , which can tell you whether this policy is likely to provide coverage to a driver for collision damage to a rental vehicle.

Every validation reports one of the following statuses after running the check:

| Status    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pass`    | The validation has passed entirely                                                                                                                                                               |
| `fail`    | The policy has been determined to be invalid on this validation                                                                                                                                  |
| `caution` | The validation is not entirely `pass` or `fail` and falls somewhere between the two. It's likely that you'll want to engage in a manual review, or handle this according to your risk tolerance. |
| `unknown` | Not enough data was available to determine the outcome of this validation                                                                                                                        |

  <Accordion title="Rental Vehicle Covered For Collision Damage">
    ### `rental-covered-for-collision`

Checks whether the policy is likely to have coverage for collision damage based on the collision coverage available on the policy and the policy terms of insurance agreements similar to the one used by this policy.

There are two different ways that a rental customer’s personal insurance policy my cover collision damage to a rental vehicle.

1. Their policy includes collision coverage and personal collision coverage extends to a rental vehicle.
2. Their policy is registered in a state in which policies are required to cover collision damage under their property damage terms.

If either of these are true, then the `rental-covered-for-collision` validation returns `pass`.

In order to determine if a policy meets either of these criteria, we match the insurance agreement for this policy to similar insurance agreements we’ve collected from the same insurance carrier and the same state, along with any relevant state regulations and synthesize these resources to come up with a determination about the likelihood of this policy’s coverage.

While many insurance agreements _do_ extend collision coverage to their insureds when operating a rental vehicle, there are many situations in which this is not the case, and we’ve built a proprietary artificial intelligence validation engine which has allowed us to match a given policy to similar insuring agreements to determine if this policy is likely to extend collision coverage to a rental vehicle.

| Status    | Cause                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pass`    | The policy would cover an insured for collision damage to their rental either because of their personal collision coverage or because of property damage coverage required by the state. |
| `fail`    | The policy is unlikely to have coverage for collision damage to a rental                                                                                                                 |
| `caution` | If the policy is matched to a set of forms which includes conflicting answers about coverage, we return `fail` to indicate that the policy may go either way                             |
| `unknown` | We do not have the data available to make a confident recommendation about whether or not the given policy would cover collision damage to a rental vehicle                              |

For this insight, we also return a message and message code, which can be used to explain to the user why the policy is or isn't likely to cover collision damage to a rental vehicle.
| Message Code | Validation Status | Message |
| ------------ | ------- | ----- |
| coll-extends-to-rental | `pass` | The policy has collision coverage and the matching policy agreements indicate that collision coverage extends to rental vehicles |
| pd-covers-rental-collision | `pass` | The policy is registered in a state in which policies are required to cover collision damage under their property damage terms |
| coll-extends-to-rental-with-conflict | `caution` | The policy has collision coverage, but the matching policy agreements have conflicting answers about whether collision coverage extends to rental vehicles |
| coll-extends-to-rental-with-unknown | `unknown` | The policy has collision coverage, but we do not have enough information to determine if the policy extends collision coverage to rental vehicles |
| coll-does-not-extend-to-rental | `fail` | The policy has collision coverage, but the matching policy agreements indicate that collision coverage does not extend to rental vehicles |
| coll-not-present | `fail` | The policy does not have collision coverage, and therefore cannot extend collision coverage to rental vehicles |

## Validation Response

When you call the validation api, every validation you requested will be run, and you'll recieve a response with an overall status determination of either `pass`, `fail`, or `caution`.

- `pass` means that the policy succeded in passing all validations
- `fail` means that one or more validations failed
- `caution` means that one or more validations had a status of `caution` and that we recommend a manual review of the policy

The response also contains two other fields:

- `summary` - An object containing the names of all validations on the policy and their statuses
- `validations` - An object containing the validaiton response object for each of the validations run.
