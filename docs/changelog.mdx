**New Feature Release:** platform support & destination clients

The Axle team is rolling out support for platform partners, who can now scalably offer Axle's insurance verification services to their customers.

Platforms can manage their customers' Axle integrations via the new destination clients feature. This includes the ability to create destination clients and call other Axle APIs on their behalf.

To learn more, check out the new [Axle for Platforms](/guides/platform-integration) guide.

- Add `null` type support for individual fields in Account and Policy response objects to improve data transparency and actionability
  - Individual fields will return `null` values when:
    - The carrier data source supports the field, but no information is present for the selected Account or Policy.
    - The carrier data source does not support that field.
  - Optional fields, such as `Policy.coverages["BI"].property` or `Policy.coverages["UMPD"].deductible` may return `null` or `undefined`
    - `null` - The carrier data source supports the field, but no information is present for the selected Account or Policy.
    - `undefined` - The carrier data source supports the field and data is available that specifies that the field does not exist on the Account or Policy.
  - Example Policy:

```json
{
	"...",
	"policyNumber": "123456789",
	"isActive": true,
	"effectiveDate": null,
	"expirationDate": "2023-10-22T04:00:00.000Z",
	"address": {
		"addressLine1": "123 Main St.",
		"addressLine2": null,
		"city": "New York",
		"state": "NY",
		"postalCode": "10014",
		"country": "US",
	},
	"coverages": [
		{
            "code": "PD",
            "label": "Property Damage",
            "limitPerAccident": null, // No information was available from carrier data source
            "deductible": undefined, // The carrier data source specifies that here is no deductible present for this coverage
            "property": "prp_83sD63h82bbeu2Dgn"
        },
		"..."
	],
	"..."
}
```

- Clarification
  - `Policy.insureds.type` is an optional field, and therefore should be used for display purposes only. The Axle team is working on refining this field to add more specificity and accuracy.
  - `Policy.thirdParties.type` has a default value of `interest`. If you do not find a thirdParty of type `lienholder` or `lessor` on the policy, the data source may not have specified this classifiation.
