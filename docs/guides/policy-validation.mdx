description: "Evaluate a set of Rules against a policy to determine if your application's requirements are met."

## Overview

When embedding insurance verification into your application, you may want to evaluate whether a shared insurance policy meets your business' requirements. Each supported Rule is an individual check evaluated against the [Policy](/api-reference/policies/policy) object to determine if the Policy meets a certain requirement or set of requirements.

For example, the `policy-active` Rule checks if the policy is currently active, evaluating to `pass` if the `isActive` field of the policy is `true` and `fail` if it is `false`. If `isActive` is `null` (not provided by the insurance carrier), this Rule will resolve to `unknown`.

Some Rules are more complex, providing additional insight not found on the Policy object. For example, the `rental-covered-for-collision` Rule provides guidance on whether a policy affords coverage for collision damage when an insured is driving a rental vehicle.

Some Rules require additional input to be evaluated. For example, the `expiration-date-comparison` Rule requires an input date to compare against the policy's expiration date. For more details on the additional inputs that a Rule may require, refer to [Supported Rules](/guides/policy-validation#supported-rules).

Each Rule evaluates to one of the following statuses:

| Status    | Description                                                                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pass`    | The policy meets all requirements of the Rule                                                             |
| `fail`    | The policy does not meet all the requirements of the Rule                                                 |
| `caution` | The policy only partially meets the requirements of the Rule or the Rule returns an inconclusive outcome. |
| `unknown` | Not enough data was available to determine the outcome of the Rule                                        |

## Requesting Evaluation Rules

You can request that a Policy be evaluated against a specified set of Rules through the [Validate Policy](/api-reference/policies/validate-policy) endpoint. Each Rule you requested will be run, and you'll receive a response with an overall status determination of either `pass`, `fail`, or `caution`.

- `pass` means that the policy succeded in passing against all of the specified Rules.
- `fail` means that one or more specified Rules evaluated to a status of `fail`.
- `caution` means that one or more specified Rules evaluated to a status of `caution`. In most cases, it is recommended to complete a manual review of the policy.

The response also contains two other fields:

- `summary` - An object containing the names of all Rules on the policy and their resolved statuses.
- `rules` - An object containing the names of each Rules and their run details.

## Supported Rules

<Info>
  The Axle team is actively working on adding additional supported Rules. Please
  reach out with any suggestions!
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Policy Active">
  ### `policy-active`

Evaluates whether the policy is currently active.

| Status    | Cause                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pass`    | The policy is currently active                                                                        |
| `fail`    | The policy is not currently active                                                                    |
| `caution` | The `isActive` field is `null`, meaning Axle could not confirm the `isActive` status with the carrier |
| `unknown` | The `isActive` field is `undefined`, meaning it's a manual policy                                     |

```typescript Example Rule
"policy-active": {
  "status": "pass",
  "metadata": {
    "isActive": true
  }
}
```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rental Vehicle Covered For Collision Damage">
    ### `rental-covered-for-collision`

    Evaluates the likelihood that the policy provides coverage for collision damage when an insured is driving a rental vehicle, based on the collision coverage available on the policy and the policy terms of insurance agreements similar to the one used by this policy.

    There are three ways that a userâ€™s auto insurance policy may cover collision damage to a rental vehicle.

    1. Their policy includes collision coverage and personal collision coverage extends to a rental vehicle.
    2. Their policy is registered in a state in which policies are required to cover collision damage to a rental vehicle under property damage liability terms.
    3. Their policy is registered in a state in which policies are required to cover collision damage to a rental vehicle under an endorsement.

    If any of these are true, then the `rental-covered-for-collision` Rule resolves to `pass`.

    #### Rental Coverage Validation AI

    In order to determine if a policy meets these criteria, Axle's Validation AI matches the auto policy to a repository of up-to-date policy agreements (also known as forms) as well as any relevant state regulations, and then synthesizes these resources into a recommendation.

    <Warning>
      The `rental-covered-for-collision` recommendation may not apply the following scenarios:
      - long term rentals (greater than 30 days)
      - rental of medium or heavy duty vehicles (above 10,000 lbs)
      - use of temporary substitute vehicles (such as replacement or loaner vehicle)
      - use of rental vehicle for TNC, DNC, or other auto business
      - rentals outside of the continental United States

      The recommendation made by the Rental Coverage Validation AI should not be treated as legal advice. It is made on a "best-effort" basis. When messaging the recommendation to your application's user,
    </Warning>

| Status    | Cause                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pass`    | The policy is likely to cover an insured for collision damage to their rental vehicle either because of their personal collision coverage or due to state regulations. |
| `fail`    | The policy is unlikely to provide coverage for collision damage to a rental vehicle.                                                                                   |
| `caution` | The Rental Coverage Validation AI is not confident in its recommendation.                                                                                              |
| `unknown` | The policy cannot be matched to the required resources to make a recommendation.                                                                                       |

This Validation also returns a message and message code, which can be used to explain to the user why the policy is or is not likely to cover collision damage to a rental vehicle.

| Message Code                        | Evaluation Status | Message                                                                                                                                                     |

| coll-extends-to-rental-with-unknown | `unknown`         | The policy has collision coverage, but there is not enough information to determine if the policy extends collision coverage to rental vehicles.            |
| coll-does-not-extend-to-rental      | `fail`            | The policy has collision coverage, but the matching policy agreements indicate that collision coverage does not extend to rental vehicles.                  |
| coll-not-present                    | `fail`            | The policy does not have collision coverage, and therefore cannot extend collision coverage to rental vehicles.                                             |

  <Accordion title="Policy Expiration Date Comparison">
  ### `expiration-date-comparison`

Given an input date, evaluates whether the policy's expiration date is greater than or equal to (on or after) the input date.

| Status    | Cause                                                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pass`    | The policy's expiration date is on or after the provided input date. |
| `fail`    | The policy's expiration date is before the provided input date.      |
| `unknown` | The policy's expiration date is `null`.                              |

This Rule requires additional input to be evaluated. Specifically, the `input` must include a `date` property as an ISO 8601 string, representing the date to compare against the policy's expiration date.

For example, valid input dates could be `2025-01-01` or `2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`. If an invalid `date` is provided, this Rule will return a `400` response code.

```typescript
{
  "rule": "expiration-date-comparison",
  "input": {
    "date": "2025-01-01"
  }
}
```

The returned evaluation will include

- The policy's expiration date.
- The input date that was provided.

```typescript
"expiration-date-comparison": {
  "status": "pass",
  "metadata": {
    "policyExpirationDate": "2025-02-01",
    "input": {
      "date": "2025-01-01"
    }
  }
}
```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Collision Coverage Meet My Requirements?">

  ### `collision-coverage-meets-my-requirements`
  
  Evaluates whether the policy has collision coverage and if the coverage meets specific deductible requirements. This rule can evaluate coverage requirements for a specific vehicle (using VIN) or for the entire policy.

  **Input Parameters**
  - `vin` (optional): The Vehicle Identification Number to check for collision coverage specific to a vehicle.
  - `deductible` (optional): A specific collision deductible amount you want to verify against the policy.

  **Evaluation Criteria**

  The Rule is evaluated based on the following two criterias. Both of these criteria must be true for the `collision-coverage-meets-my-requirements` Rule to resolve to `pass`.

  1. `collision-exists`: Determines if collision coverage is present on the policy for any vehicle or, if a `vin` is provided, for a specified vehicle. 

  2. `collision-deductible-comparison` (optional): Verifies if the provided `deductible` is less than or equal to the deductible specified in the collision coverage of the policy. This criteria will only run if `collision-exists` results in a `pass` and the optional `deductible` is provided.
      -  If no `vin` is provided, the provided `deductible` will be verified against all collision coverages listed on the policy. 
      - If a `vin` is provided, the provided `deductible` will be verified against only the collision coverage listed for the specified vehicle. 


  | Status    | Cause                                                                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pass`    | The policy has collision coverage and meets all specified requirements (`deductible` and/or `vin` if provided) |
| `fail`    | The policy either lacks collision coverage or doesn't meet the specified deductible requirements                      |
| `unknown` | Not enough information was available to evaluate the coverage requirements 

This Rule also returns a message and message code, which can be used to explain to the user why the Rule failed to result in a `pass`.

| Message Code                        | Evaluation Status | Message                                                                                                                                                     |

| coll-valid-deductible          | `pass`            | The COLL coverage(s) on this policy have deductible(s) less than or equal to [inputDeductible].                       |
| coll-does-not-exist          | `fail`            | The COLL coverage does not exist on this policy.                       |
| coll-does-not-exist-for-vin          | `fail`            | The COLL coverage does not exist on this policy for the specified vehicle.                       |
| coll-invalid-deductible-for-vin          | `fail`            | The COLL coverage(s) on this policy for this specified vehicle all have deductibles greater than [inputDeductible].                       |
| coll-invalid-deductible          | `fail`            | The COLL coverage(s) on this policy all have deductibles greater than [inputDeductible].                       |
| coll-unknown-deductible          | `unknown`            | The COLL coverage(s) on this policy have unknown deductibles.                       |


**Example Usage**

This example Rule will verify if the policy contains collision coverage for the vehicle with the given `vin` and that the `deductible` for that coverage is less than or equal to $1,000.
