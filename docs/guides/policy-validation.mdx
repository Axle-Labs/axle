description: "Evaluate a set of Rules against a policy to determine if your application's requirements are met."

## Overview

When embedding insurance verification into your application, you may want to evaluate whether a shared insurance policy meets your business' requirements. Each supported Rule is an individual check evaluated against the [Policy](/api-reference/policies/policy) object to determine if the Policy meets a certain requirement or set of requirements.

For example, the `policy-active` Rule checks if the policy is currently active, evaluating to `pass` if the `isActive` field of the policy is `true` and `fail` if it is `false`. If `isActive` is `null` (not provided by the insurance carrier), this Rule will resolve to `unknown`.

Some Rules are more complex, providing additional insight not found on the Policy object. For example, the `rental-covered-for-collision` Rule provides guidance on whether a policy affords coverage for collision damage when an insured is driving a rental vehicle.

Some Rules require additional input to be evaluated. For example, the `expiration-date-comparison` Rule requires an input date to compare against the policy's expiration date. For more details on the additional inputs that a Rule may require, refer to [Supported Rules](/guides/policy-validation#supported-rules).

Each Rule evaluates to one of the following statuses:

| Status    | Description                                                                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pass`    | The policy meets all requirements of the Rule                                                             |
| `fail`    | The policy does not meet all the requirements of the Rule                                                 |
| `caution` | The policy only partially meets the requirements of the Rule or the Rule returns an inconclusive outcome. |
| `unknown` | Not enough data was available to determine the outcome of the Rule                                        |

## Requesting Evaluation Rules

You can request that a Policy be evaluated against a specified set of Rules through the [Validate Policy](/api-reference/policies/validate-policy) endpoint. Each Rule you requested will be run, and you'll receive a response with an overall status determination of either `pass`, `fail`, or `caution`.

- `pass` means that the policy succeeded in passing against all of the specified Rules.
- `fail` means that one or more specified Rules evaluated to a status of `fail`.
- `caution` means that one or more specified Rules evaluated to a status of `caution`. In most cases, it is recommended to complete a manual review of the policy.

The response also contains two other fields:

- `summary` - An object containing the names of all Rules on the policy and their resolved statuses.
- `rules` - An object containing the names of each Rules and their run details.

## Supported Rules

<Info>
  The Axle team is actively working on adding additional supported Rules. Please
  reach out with any suggestions!
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Policy is Active">
  ### `policy-active`

Evaluates whether the policy is currently active.

| Status    | Cause                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pass`    | The policy is currently active                                                                        |
| `fail`    | The policy is not currently active                                                                    |
| `caution` | The `isActive` field is `null`, meaning Axle could not confirm the `isActive` status with the carrier |
| `unknown` | The `isActive` field is `undefined`, meaning it's a manual policy                                     |

```typescript Example Rule
"policy-active": {
  "status": "pass",
  "metadata": {
    "isActive": true
  }
}
```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rental Vehicle is Covered For Collision Damage">
    ### `rental-covered-for-collision`

    Evaluates the likelihood that the policy provides coverage for collision damage when an insured is driving a rental vehicle, based on the collision coverage available on the policy and the policy terms of insurance agreements similar to the one used by this policy.

    There are three ways that a userâ€™s auto insurance policy may cover collision damage to a rental vehicle.

    1. Their policy includes collision coverage and personal collision coverage extends to a rental vehicle.
    2. Their policy is registered in a state in which policies are required to cover collision damage to a rental vehicle under property damage liability terms.
    3. Their policy is registered in a state in which policies are required to cover collision damage to a rental vehicle under an endorsement.

    If any of these are true, then the `rental-covered-for-collision` Rule resolves to `pass`.

    #### Rental Coverage Validation AI

    In order to determine if a policy meets these criteria, Axle's Validation AI matches the auto policy to a repository of up-to-date policy agreements (also known as forms) as well as any relevant state regulations, and then synthesizes these resources into a recommendation.

    <Warning>
      The `rental-covered-for-collision` recommendation may not apply the following scenarios:
      - long term rentals (greater than 30 days)
      - rental of medium or heavy duty vehicles (above 10,000 lbs)
      - use of temporary substitute vehicles (such as replacement or loaner vehicle)
      - use of rental vehicle for TNC, DNC, or other auto business
      - rentals outside of the continental United States

      The recommendation made by the Rental Coverage Validation AI should not be treated as legal advice. It is made on a "best-effort" basis.

   </Warning>

| Status    | Cause                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pass`    | The policy is likely to cover an insured for collision damage to their rental vehicle either because of their personal collision coverage or due to state regulations. |
| `fail`    | The policy is unlikely to provide coverage for collision damage to a rental vehicle.                                                                                   |
| `caution` | The Rental Coverage Validation AI is not confident in its recommendation.                                                                                              |
| `unknown` | The policy cannot be matched to the required resources to make a recommendation.                                                                                       |

This Validation also returns a message and message code, which can be used to explain to the user why the policy is or is not likely to cover collision damage to a rental vehicle.

| Message Code                        | Evaluation Status | Message                                                                                                                                                     |

  <Accordion title="Policy Expiration Date is After Provided Date">
  ### `expiration-date-comparison`

Given an input date, evaluates whether the policy's expiration date is greater than or equal to (on or after) the input date.

| Status    | Cause                                                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pass`    | The policy's expiration date is on or after the provided input date. |
| `fail`    | The policy's expiration date is before the provided input date.      |
| `unknown` | The policy's expiration date is `null`.                              |

This Rule requires additional input to be evaluated. Specifically, the `input` must include a `date` property as an ISO 8601 string, representing the date to compare against the policy's expiration date.

For example, valid input dates could be `2025-01-01` or `2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`. If an invalid `date` is provided, this Rule will return a `400` response code.

```typescript
{
  "rule": "expiration-date-comparison",
  "input": {
    "date": "2025-01-01"
  }
}
```

The returned evaluation will include

- The policy's expiration date.
- The input date that was provided.

```typescript
"expiration-date-comparison": {
  "status": "pass",
  "metadata": {
    "policyExpirationDate": "2025-02-01",
    "input": {
      "date": "2025-01-01"
    }
  }
}
```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Collision Coverage Meets Requirements">
    ### `collision-coverage-meets-requirements`
    
    Evaluates whether the policy has collision coverage and if the coverage meets specific deductible requirements. This rule can evaluate coverage requirements for a specific vehicle (using VIN) or for the entire policy.

    **Input Parameters**
    - `vin` (optional): The Vehicle Identification Number to check for collision coverage specific to a vehicle.
    - `deductible` (optional): A specific collision deductible amount you want to verify against the policy.

    **Evaluation Criteria**

    The Rule is evaluated based on the following two criteria. Both of these criteria must be true for the `collision-coverage-meets-requirements` Rule to resolve to `pass`.

    1. `collision-exists`: Determines if collision coverage is present on the policy for any vehicle or, if a `vin` is provided, for a specified vehicle.

    2. `collision-deductible-comparison` (optional): Verifies if the provided `deductible` is less than or equal to the deductible specified in the collision coverage of the policy. This criteria will only run if `collision-exists` results in a `pass` and the optional `deductible` is provided.
        -  If no `vin` is provided, the provided `deductible` will be verified against all collision coverages listed on the policy.
        - If a `vin` is provided, the provided `deductible` will be verified against only the collision coverage listed for the specified vehicle.

| Status    | Cause                                                                                                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pass`    | The policy has collision coverage and meets all specified requirements (`deductible` and/or `vin` if provided) |
| `fail`    | The policy either lacks collision coverage or doesn't meet the specified deductible requirements               |
| `unknown` | Not enough information was available to evaluate the coverage requirements                                     |

This Rule also returns a message and message code, which can be used to explain to the user why the Rule failed to result in a `pass`.

  <Accordion title="Comprehensive Coverage Meets Requirements">

    ### `comprehensive-coverage-meets-requirements`

    Evaluates whether the policy has comprehensive coverage and if the coverage meets specific deductible requirements. This rule can evaluate coverage requirements for a specific vehicle (using VIN) or for the entire policy.

    **Input Parameters**
    - `vin` (optional): The Vehicle Identification Number to check for comprehensive coverage specific to a vehicle.
    - `deductible` (optional): A specific comprehensive deductible amount you want to verify against the policy.

    **Evaluation Criteria**

    The Rule is evaluated based on the following two criteria. Both of these criteria must be true for the `comprehensive-coverage-meets-requirements` Rule to resolve to `pass`.

    1. `comprehensive-exists`: Determines if comprehensive coverage is present on the policy for any vehicle or, if a `vin` is provided, for a specified vehicle.

    2. `comprehensive-deductible-comparison` (optional): Verifies if the provided `deductible` is less than or equal to the deductible specified in the comprehensive coverage of the policy. This criteria will only run if `comprehensive-exists` results in a `pass` and the optional `deductible` is provided.
      -  If no `vin` is provided, the provided `deductible` will be verified against all comprehensive coverages listed on the policy.
      - If a `vin` is provided, the provided `deductible` will be verified against only the comprehensive coverage listed for the specified vehicle.

    ### `uninsured-underinsured-pd-coverage-meets-requirements`

    Evaluates whether a policy includes uninsured motorist (UM), underinsured motorist (UIM), or uninsured/underinsured motorist (UUIM) property damage coverage and verifies if the coverage(s) meet the specified limit requirements.

    **Input Parameters**

    - `limitPerAccident` (optional): The limitPerAccident amount you want to verify against the policy.

    **Evaluation Criteria**

    The Rule is evaluated based on the following criteria. If no limit is specified in the input, the Rule evaluates solely on the presence of any uninsured motorist (UM), underinsured motorist (UIM), or uninsured/underinsured motorist (UUIM) property damage coverage on the policy.

    1. `uninsured-underinsured-pd-exists`: Determines if UM, UIM, or UUIM motorist property damage coverage is present on the policy.

    2. `uninsured-underinsured-pd-limit-per-accident-comparison` (if applicable): Determines if the `limitPerAccident` on the policy's UM, UIM, or UUIM property damage coverage  is greater than or equal to the provided `limitPerAccident`.

    | Status    | Cause                                                                                                    |
    | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `pass`    | The policy has at least one of UM, UIM, or UUIM property damage coverage and meets all specified limit requirements.                        |
    | `fail`    | The policy either doesn't have any UM, UIM, or UUIM property damage coverage, or has at least one but doesn't meet the specified limit requirements. |
    | `unknown` | Not enough information was available to evaluate the coverage requirements.

    This Rule also returns a message and message code which can be used to explain to the user why the Rule failed to result in a `pass`.

    ### `insureds-match`

    Evaluates whether all of the input insured names are listed on the Axle policy.

    | Status    | Cause                                                                |
    | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `pass`    | All of the input insured names are listed on the Axle policy. |
    | `caution`    | One or more of the input insured names passed a fuzzy match. This occurs when either the input name or Axle policy name is missing an additional first name or middle name (e.g. "John Tracy Smith" vs. "John Smith"). |
    | `fail`    | One or more of the input insured names were not listed on the Axle policy.      |
    | `unknown` | An error occurred during validation.                              |

    **Input Parameters**
    - `insuredNames`: An array of full names provided as strings. Each name should be provided in the format `"firstName middleName lastName suffix"`

    <Info>
    This Rule currently does not support nickname matching. Please contact the Axle team if this is a feature of interest.

    Additionally, it is unlikely that insureds across households will be present on a single insurance policy. Please ensure that the input only contains insured names you expect to be on the policy.

<Accordion title="Required Policy Information is Present">
  ### `required-policy-information-is-present`

Evaluates if the policy either has (1) certain required fields present OR (2) at least one declarations page. If either sub-rule passes, the overall Rule resolves to `pass`. Otherwise, it resolves to `fail`.

This Rule combines two separate sub-rules:

    1. `fields-exist` â€“ Verifies that all fields specified by your `requiredFields` input are present on the policy. If every requested field is found, this Rule resolves to `pass`; otherwise, it resolves to `fail` and includes a `missingFields` list in the metadata.
    2. `declarations-page-exists` â€“ Checks whether the policy has at least one document classified by Axle as a declaration page.

| Status | Cause                                                                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pass` | The policy has all required fields, or there is a declarations page (or both).        |
| `fail` | Neither the required fields nor a declarations page could be confirmed on the policy. |

**Input Parameters**

- `requiredFields`: An object used to specify which fields must exist on the policy. Each key maps to a boolean (or nested object / array structure) indicating whether that particular field is required. The shape of the object mirrors the Axle Policy Schema.

Below is an example request specifying all the possible required fields that can be checked for existence. If you receive a 400 Input Validation error, please check that you provided only fields listed in the example below.

If either the required fields or the declarations page check is satisfied, the Rule evaluates to `pass`.

## Validation Templates

Templates can be used to simplify the configuration of Rules in your application by storing the list of rules with any default inputs. Validation Templates can also access dynamic input values from custom metadata shared via Start Ignition or individual Validate request. 

<Info>
  Validation Templates are currently in development. Please reach out to the Axle team if you would like to enable them for your client or platform.
</Info>

### Example Template
```json
{
  "id": "tem_jsK9vrCIfABlCW7PqIknc",
  "rules": [
    {
      "rule": "collision-coverage-meets-requirements",
      "input": {
        "vin": {
          "source": "customerVin", // Key of dynamic value from Ignition metadata
          "default": "WMWRC33404TJ15309" // Optional default input value, will be overridden by dynamic value if provided
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2025-06-10T13:57:22.300Z",
  "modifiedAt": "2025-06-10T13:57:22.300Z"
}
```

### Usage
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or modify Validation Template">
    **Note:** Currently, Axle does not support creating or modifying templates via API. We hope to launch this in the near future. Please reach out to the Axle team to configure your Templates.  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide dynamic inputs to Ignition metadata (optional)">
    Include metadata in [Start Ignition](/api-reference/ignition/start-ignition) to serve as dynamic Rule inputs. Ensure the metadata object is formatted correctly with the keys specified in your Template and the values conforming to the associated Rule input(s).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve Validation Templates">
    After creating a template, you can store the Template identifier in your application or retrieve a list of Templates configured for your Axle client or destination client when needed. 
    
    See [Get Validation Config](/api-reference/configs/get-config-validation) for more details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Policy Validation with Template">
    Use the Template identifier to make a request to [Validate Policy with Template](/api-reference/policies/validate-policy-template). Ensure the request object is formatted correctly with the keys specified in your Template and the values conforming to the associated Rule input(s).

    <Warning>Providing inputs to the Validate Policy endpoint will overwrite any metadata provided via Start Ignition.</Warning>
  </Step>
