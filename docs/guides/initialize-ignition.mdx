title: "Initialize Ignition"
description: "This guide will help you understand how to display Axle's Ignition session to your users."
---

Once you have generated an Ignition token, you can guide the user to complete Axle's Ignition session for the user to share their insurance information.

### Open Ignition in new window

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Ignition in new window">
    Add link to the the constructed `ignitionUri` using an achor tag or
    other mechanism. 
    
    ```HTML 
    <a
      href="https://ignition.axle.insure/?token={ignitionToken}"
      target="_blank"
    >
      Share your insurance via Axle
    </a>
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Ignition completion">Once a user completes the Ignition session, capture the `authCode` by either handling the parameters after Ignition redirects back to your application using the specified `redirectUri` or processing the `ignition.completed` webhook event.</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  This method is best used for **asynchronous** user interactions such as via
  email, SMS, push notification, etc. that do not require immediate user action
  after insurance verification.
</Tip>

### Web: Display Ignition in iframe

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open iframe">
    Initialize the constructed `ignitionUri` within an iframe modal.
    <Note>
      If you would like to receive `MessageEvent` messages to your main application Window from Ignition, you must specify an `origin` as a URL parameter when initalizing Ignition. The origin should not include any path, just the base domain as a URI.

      Example: `https://ignition.axle.insure/?origin=http://example.com`

    </Note>

    <Tip>
      Axle recommends setting up an iframe in your application's client that is full viewport width and height, as Ignition is optimized for responsiveness across all viewports.

      For the best experience, you can set the background color and opacity (allowing a peek at your application's views or components) of Ignition. Contact the Axle team to enable this configuration!

    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Listen for MessageEvent">Implement `window.addEventListener` to listen for Window `MessageEvent`. For added security, verify the origin of the message is the Axle Ignition base domain (e.g., `https://ignition.axle.insure`)</Step>
  <Step title="Process Ignition event">
    Process each Ignition event in your application's client. For example, when a user completes Ignition, process the event with `status=complete` by sending the `authCode` to your application's protected
    services to be exchanged for an `accessToken`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

```HTML Page with iframe and eventListener (example)
<html>
  <head>
    <script>
      window.addEventListener("message", (message) => {
        if (event.origin === "https://ignition.axle.insure") {
          switch (message.data.status) {
            case "complete":
              console.log("Received completed message from Axle Ignition...", message.data);
              onCompleted(message.data.authCode);
              break;
            case "exit":
              console.log("Received exited message from Axle Ignition...", message.data);
              onExited(message.data.step);
              break;
            case "error":
              console.log("Received errored message from Axle Ignition...", message.data);
              onErrored(message.data.message);
              break;
            default:
              console.log("Received unknown message from Axle Ignition...");
              break;
          }
        } else {
          // Ignore or handle messages from other origins
        }
      });
    </script>
    <style>
      .ignition {
        height: 100vh;
        width: 100vw;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <iframe
      src="https://ignition.axle.insure/?token=ign_GZQkqPDF7JSY8vJnSU9LP&origin=http://example.com"
      class="ignition"
    ></iframe>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Mobile: Display Ignition in native view

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open webview">
    - On iOS, open the constructed `ignitionUri` within the natively supported
    `ASWebAuthentication` session ([full
    documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/authenticating_a_user_through_a_web_service)).
    - On Android, open the constructed `ignitionUri` within `Chrome Custom Tabs`
    ([full
    documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/integration-guide/))
    to create an in-app session and Android App Links ([full
    documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links)) to
    deep-link back into your application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Ignition event">
    Process each Ignition event that is returned to your application's client.
    For example, when a user completes Ignition, process the event with
    `status=complete` by sending the `authCode` to your application's protected
    services to be exchanged for an `accessToken`.
  </Step>
