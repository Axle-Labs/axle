### Overview

Our asynchronous document analysis uses generative AI to extract information from a declarations page or ID card and convert it
into a Policy object. [Analyze Document](/api-references/documents/analyze-document) uses webhooks to notify the client when the document analysis process is complete. If the document
analysis was successful, an auth code and the policy id are included in the webhook payload. The auth code can be exchanged for an access token,
which can be used to retrieve the Policy object.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make a request to our Analyze Document API" titleSize="h3">
    See [Analyze Document](/api-references/documents/analyze-document) for
    details on how to invoke our document analysis process.

    ```bash Request Sample

    curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.axle.insure/documents/analyze \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'x-client-id: cli_mZj6YGXhQyQnccN97aXbq' \
    --header 'x-client-secret: RZM-5BErZuChKqycbCS1O' \
    --data '{
    "webhookUri": "https://example.com/insurance/webhook"
    }

    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Analyze Document event" titleSize="h3">
    Once the document analysis completes, an `POST` request will be sent to 
    the webhookUri that was passed in to Analyze Document request body. The webhook
    payload will include the below:

    ```json Example webhook request body
    {
    "id": "<event_id>",
    "type": "document-analysis.completed",
    "data": {
        "client": "<client-id>",
        "token": "ign_Z4ni-JHBvkn9PlKJHPEwk",
        ...{ parameters }
    },
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
    ```

| Type                        | Data                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| document-analysis.completed | client : String, token : String, authCode: String, policyId: String |
| document-analysis.errored   | client : String, token : String                                     |

  </Step>
  <Step title="Exchange the auth code for an access token" titleSize="h3">
    If the document analysis was successful, the auth code in the webhook payload can be exchanged for an
    access token. See [Exchange Token](/api-references/tokens/exchange-token) for details
    on how to exchange an auth code for an access token.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Invoke Get Policy to retrieve the Policy object" titleSize="h3">
    Using the access token and policy id, call [Get Policy](/api-references/policies/get-policy)
    to fetch the Policy object.
  </Step>
</Steps>
