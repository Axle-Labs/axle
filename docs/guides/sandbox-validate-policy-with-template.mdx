## Step 1: Create and Complete Ignition Session

Follow the steps provided in [this guide](guides/sandbox-ignition-completion#testing-ignition-completions-in-the-sandbox) to create and complete ignition session. Once complete, note your [policy identifier](/api-reference/policies/policy#fields) which will be used to make API call to policy validation engine.

### Optional: Provide `metadata` object when generating ignition session

Include metadata in [Start Ignition](/api-reference/ignition/start-ignition) which will be used as a dynamic input in policy validation.

Ensure the metadata object is formatted correctly with the keys specified in your Template and the values conforming to the associated Rule input(s).


## Step 2: Retrieve Validation Template

Once Policy Validation feature has been activated for your client in **sandbox**, you will be able to access two sample validation templates associated with your client. 

See [Get Validation Config](api-reference/configs/get-config-validation) API call to retrieve all the templates associated with your client. Once you make this API call, you will get template identifier which you can use along with your policy identifier to validate the policy.

Each validation template has following structure:

```json
{
  rule: "<name of the rule>", //e.g. "insureds-match"
  input: {
    "<rule parameter>": { //e.g. "insuredNames"
      default: "<default value>",
      source: "<field name you specified in ignition.metadata OR validatePolicy body>", 
    },
  },
}

```

## Step 3: Validate `policy` using template

Use the Template identifier to make a request to Validate Policy with Template. In Sandbox environment, we provide two sample templates that you can use to validate your policy.

For validation rules that need input parameters (e.g. `insureds-match`), ensure the request object is formatted correctly with the keys specified in your Template and the values conforming to the associated Rule input(s).

See [Validate Policy with Template](api-reference/policies/validate-policy-template) API call to view the format of the endpoint. 

### Optional: Provide 

For policies that need input parameter. 

For example, for rule `insureds-match`, you need to provide insured name

**Case: Loaner**

The following template has 3 rules: `collision-coverage-meets-requirements`, `comprehensive-coverage-meets-requirements` and `insureds-match` 

Only `insureds-match` needs input parameter `insuredsMatch`. You can provide

```json
{
    id: "tem_loaner_validate_case1",
    rules: [
      {
        rule: "collision-coverage-meets-requirements",
      },
      {
        rule: "comprehensive-coverage-meets-requirements",
      },
      {
        rule: "insureds-match",
        input: {
          insuredNames: {
            default: ["Jane Doe"],
            source: "names", 
          },
        },
      },
    ],
    createdAt: "2025-06-01T13:57:22.300Z",
    modifiedAt: "2025-06-10T13:57:22.300Z",
  }
```

**Case: Rental**

```json
{
    id: "tem_rental_validate_case1",
    rules: [
      {
        rule: "rental-covered-for-collision",
      },
      {
        rule: "comprehensive-coverage-meets-requirements",
      },
      {
        rule: "insureds-match",
        input: {
          insuredNames: {
            default: ["Jane Doe"],
            source: "names", 
          },
        },
      },
    ],
    createdAt: "2025-05-10T13:57:22.300Z",
    modifiedAt: "2025-06-10T13:57:22.300Z",
  }
```
