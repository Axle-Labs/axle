description: "Receive proactive notifications for updates to an insurance policy, such as policy cancellation or change in coverages."

<Warning>
  Monitoring is not enabled by default. It requires user consent and must be enabled for your client to receive account and policy events. Please contact
  the Axle team if you would like to enable this feature!
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Ignition to receive webhooks" titleSize="h3">
    Ensure that the request made to generate an Ignition token includes the webhook URL where you would like to receive notifications.

    ```bash Request Sample: cURL
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.axle.insure/ignition \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'x-client-id: cli_mZj6YGXhQyQnccN97aXbq' \
      --header 'x-client-secret: RZM-5BErZuChKqycbCS1O' \
      --data '{
      "webhookUri": "https://example.com/webhook"
    }'
    ```

    <Tip>
      Notifications can also be sent to your organization via other communication
      channels such as email or Slack. Please contact the Axle team to configure
      which events should be sent to each channel. All events will be sent via
      webhook if a `webhookUri` is provided.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Account and Policy events" titleSize="h3">
    Notifications will be triggered by the following events and will need to be processed by your application.

    - [Account events](/guides/account-events)
      - `account.modified`: Updates made to identifying details for the insurance account (e.g., name, email, phone)
      - `account.disconnected`: The account and any connected policies are no longer being monitored by Axle
    - [Policy events](/guides/policy-events)
      - `policy.modified`: Updates made to insurance policy, such as policy cancellation or change in coverages

  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve Account or Policy object" titleSize="h3">
    For security, Account and Policy events do not include the entire Account and Policy objects, but include a `ref` to identify which Account or Policy is impacted by this event. You can retrieve the object via this identifier and the `accessToken` stored in your application.

    <Info>
      Axle will continue refreshing the Account and Policy objects even if these
      events are not triggered. Refer to the `refreshedAt` date on the Account and
      Policy to determine when the data was last successfully retrieved from the
      insurance carrier.
    </Info>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate against requirements and contact user if action is required" titleSize="h3">
    - `account.disconnected`: Ask user to complete new Axle session. See [Account events](/guides/account-events) for additional guidance on messaging.
    - `policy.modified`: Validate updated policy against your application's requirements. If policy does not meet requirements, ask user to complete new Axle session.

    <Info>
      Note: If the user reconnects the same insurance account and policy, Axle will
      merge the updated information with any existing Account or Policy objects.
