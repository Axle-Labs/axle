## Overview

When embedding insurance verification into your application, you may want to evaluate whether a shared insurance policy meets your business' requirements. While creating these validations is made much easier due to Axle's universal Policy object, you can also leverage pre-built Policy Validations. Each supported Validation is an individual check run against the Policy object to determine if it meets a certain requirement or set of requirements.

For example, the `policy-active` Validation checks if the policy is currently active, resolving to `pass` if the `isActive` field of the policy is `true` and `fail` if it is `false`. If `isActive` is `null` (not provided by the insurance carrier), this Validation will resolve to `unknown`.

Some Validations are more complex, providing additional insight not found on the Policy object. For example, the `rental-covered-for-collision` Validation provides guidance on whether a policy affords coverage for collision damage when an insured is driving a rental vehicle.

Each validation resolves to one of the following statuses:

| Status    | Description                                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pass`    | The policy meets all requirements of the Validation                                                                   |
| `fail`    | The policy does not meet all the requirements of the Validation                                                       |
| `caution` | The policy only partially meets the requirements of the Validation or the Validation returns an inconclusive outcome. |
| `unknown` | Not enough data was available to determine the outcome of the Validation                                              |

## Requesting Policy Validations

You can request that a Policy be evaluated against a specified set of Validations through the [Validate Policy](/api-reference/policies/validate-policy) endpoint. Each validation you requested will be run, and you'll receive a response with an overall status determination of either `pass`, `fail`, or `caution`.

- `pass` means that the policy succeded in passing all specified Validations.
- `fail` means that one or more specified Validations failed.
- `caution` means that one or more specified Validations had a status of `caution`. In most cases, it is recommended to complete a manual review of the policy.

The response also contains two other fields:

- `summary` - An object containing the names of all Validations on the policy and their resolved statuses.
- `validations` - An object containing the names of each Validation and their run details.

## Supported Validations

<Info>
  The Axle team is actively working on adding additional supported Validations.
  Please reach out with any suggestions!

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Policy Active">
  ### `policy-active`

Evaluates whether the policy is currently active.

| Status    | Cause                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `pass`    | The policy is currently active               |
| `fail`    | The policy is not currently active           |
| `unknown` | The `isActive` field is unvailable or `null` |

```typescript Example Validation
"policy-active": {
  "status": "pass",
  "metadata": {
    "isActive": true
  }
}
```

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rental Vehicle Covered For Collision Damage">
    ### `rental-covered-for-collision`

    Evaluates the likelihood that the policy provides coverage for collision damage when an insured is driving a rental vehicle, based on the collision coverage available on the policy and the policy terms of insurance agreements similar to the one used by this policy.

    There are two ways that a userâ€™s auto insurance policy may cover collision damage to a rental vehicle.

    1. Their policy includes collision coverage and personal collision coverage extends to a rental vehicle.
    2. Their policy is registered in a state in which policies are required to cover collision damage to a rental vehicle under property damage liability terms.

    If either of these are true, then the `rental-covered-for-collision` Validation resolves to `pass`.

    #### Rental Coverage Validation AI

    In order to determine if a policy meets these criteria, Axle's Validation AI matches the auto policy to a repository of up-to-date policy agreements (also known as forms) as well as any relevant state regulations, and then synthesizes these resources into a recommendation.

    <Warning>
      The `rental-covered-for-collision` recommendation does not apply the following scenarios:
      - long term rentals (greater than 30 days)
      - rental of medium or heavy duty vehicles (above 10,000 lbs)
      - use of temporary substitute vehicles (such as replacement or loaner vehicle)
      - use of rental vehicle for TNC, DNC, or other auto business
      - rentals in the following states or territories: HI, AK, PR

      The recommendation made by the Rental Coverage Validation AI should not be treated as legal advice. It is made on a "best-effort" basis. When messaging the recommendation to your application's user,
    </Warning>

| Status    | Cause                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pass`    | The policy is likely to cover an insured for collision damage to their rental vehicle either because of their personal collision coverage or due to state regulations. |
| `fail`    | The policy is unlikely to provide coverage for collision damage to a rental vehicle.                                                                                   |
| `caution` | The Rental Coverage Validation AI is not confident in its recommendation.                                                                                              |
| `unknown` | The policy cannot be matched to the required resources to make a recommendation.                                                                                       |

This Validation also returns a message and message code, which can be used to explain to the user why the policy is or is not likely to cover collision damage to a rental vehicle.

| Message Code                        | Validation Status | Message                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| coll-extends-to-rental              | `pass`            | The policy has collision coverage and the matching policy agreements indicate that collision coverage extends to rental vehicles.                           |
| pd-covers-rental-collision          | `pass`            | The policy is underwritten in a state in which policies are required to cover collision damage under property damage liability terms.                       |
| coll-extends-to-rental-with-caution | `caution`         | The policy has collision coverage, but the matching policy agreements have conflicting answers about whether collision coverage extends to rental vehicles. |
| coll-extends-to-rental-with-unknown | `unknown`         | The policy has collision coverage, but there is not enough information to determine if the policy extends collision coverage to rental vehicles.            |
| coll-does-not-extend-to-rental      | `fail`            | The policy has collision coverage, but the matching policy agreements indicate that collision coverage does not extend to rental vehicles.                  |
| coll-not-present                    | `fail`            | The policy does not have collision coverage, and therefore cannot extend collision coverage to rental vehicles.                                             |
