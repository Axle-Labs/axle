After completing an Ignition session and exchanging the `authCode` for an `accessToken`, you can trigger an Account event through [`POST /sandbox/account/{accountId}/event`](/api-reference/sandbox/trigger-account-event) or Policy event through [`POST /sandbox/policies/{policyId}/event`](/api-reference/sandbox/trigger-policy-event).

<Tip>
  You can also test notifications sent to other communication channels such as
  email or Slack by making a request to the same Axle API endpoints. Reach out
  to the Axle team to ensure your `client` is properly configured!
</Tip>

The following [Account events](/guides/account-events) and [Policy events](guides/policy-events) are supported:

**account.modified**

You can modify Account fields to simulate an `account.modified` event. The following example will change `email`, `firstName`, and `phone` fields on an existing Account.

```
{
  "email": "updatedEmail@axle.insure",
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "phone" "+14041230101"
}
```

**account.disconnected**

You can test `account.disconnected` event by setting the connection status to one of the "inactive" states. Refer to Account object for all the available [cases](/api-reference/accounts/account).

```
{
  "connection": {
      "status": "credentials-expired"
  }
}
```

<Info>
  When account has been set as `disconnected`, your user will need to complete
  an Axle Ignition session to reconnect it. If the user reconnects the same
  insurance account and policy, Axle will merge the updated information with any
  existing Account or Policy objects. More info on `account.disconnected` can be
  found [here](/guides/account-events#account-disconnected).
</Info>

**policy.modified**

You can modify Policy fields to simulate a `policy.modified` event. The following example will set Policy as inactive (e.g., the policy has been cancelled) as well as update the Policy address.

```
{
  "isActive": false,
  "address": {
      "addressLine1": "New Street",
      "addressLine2": "New Apt",
      "city": "Atlanta",
      "postalCode": "30315",
      "state": "GA",
      "country: "USA"
  }
}
```
