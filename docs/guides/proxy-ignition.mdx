title: "Proxy Ignition"
description: "As an alternative to initializing Ignition, proxy insurance information on behalf of your user to Axle for processing and/or verification."

### Overview

Axle’s Ignition session is the main interface that allows your users to connect to their insurance accounts and authorize access to scoped data from their insurance policies.
However, sometimes insurance information is shared to you on behalf of your user, such as when an insurance carrier or agent sends documents via mail directly to the policy lienholder.

In these cases, you can "proxy" an Ignition session, effectively sharing information on behalf of your user instead of initializing Ignition for the user to complete it themself. Axle will then process and/or verify this information, depending on the use case.

<Warning>
  When proxying an Ignition session, you are implying that you have received
  consent from user to share their insurance information with Axle, as persuant
  to Axle's [Privacy Policy](https://www.axle.insure/legal/privacy-policy) and
  [End User Terms](https://www.axle.insure/legal/end-user-terms).
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Ignition to receive webhooks" titleSize="h3">
    Ensure that the request made to generate an Ignition token includes the `webhookUri` where you would like to receive Ignition events.

    ```bash Request Sample: cURL
    curl --request POST \
      --url https://api.axle.insure/ignition \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --header 'x-client-id: cli_mZj6YGXhQyQnccN97aXbq' \
      --header 'x-client-secret: RZM-5BErZuChKqycbCS1O' \
      --data '{
      "webhookUri": "https://example.com/webhook"
    }'
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send proxy request" titleSize="h3">
    Begin the insurance processing and/or verification by selecting a supported [`operation`](/guides/proxy-ignition#supported-operations) along with your users insurance information in the request body. See [Proxy Ignition](/api-reference/ignition/proxy-ignition) API reference for more details on how to invoke the Proxy Ignition endpoint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process Ignition events" titleSize="h3">
    Once the submitted insurance information has been processed and/or verified, an `POST` request will be sent to
    the `webhookUri` specified when generating the Ignition session. See [Ignition events](/guides/ignition-events) for more details on the payloads of each event. 

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="ignition.completed">
        Continue from Step 3 in the [Quickstart](/guides/quickstart) guide. In
        summary, you will need to exchange the short-lived `authCode` specified for
        an `accessToken`, which can then be used to retrieve Axle Account and Policy
        objects.

        <Tip>
          The `result` of the `ignition.completed` event will be the selected proxy `operation`. If you are using the same `webhookUri` across proxied and non-proxied Ignition sessions, you can use this result to filter the events.
        </Tip>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="ignition.errored">
        Each operation will specify different `message`, which can be used to
        determine next steps. Unless specified, retrying the Proxy Ignition request
        with the same submitted insurance information will not result in a different
        outcome.

### Supported operations

<Info>
  Currently, only certain operations are supported by this the Ignition proxy
  operation. Please reach out to the Axle team if you would to request new operations.
</Info>

<Accordion title="Transform insurance carrier policy document into Axle Policy" icon="file">
Leverage Axle's Document AI to extract information from a policy document, such as a declarations page, policy renewal, ID card, or new business binder, and transform it into an [Axle Policy](/api-reference/policies/policy) object.

In the request body, you must provide the following: 
- operation: `process-document`
- input: 
  - `name` for the document (such as the unique identifier of the document in your system)
  - `source` of the document (either `user` or `carrier`)
  - `url` that can used to access the document. For extra security, we recommend using a url with an expiry, such as an AWS S3 signed url. 

<Info>
When Proxy Ignition request is made, we will process provided document immediately.
</Info>

```json Example request body
{
  "operation": "process-document",
  "input": {
    "name": "DOC_ABC",
    "source": "carrier",
    "url": "https://your-document-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/declarations-page.pdf"
  }
} 
```

If the operation does not succeed, the following `message` will be returned as part of the `ignition.errored`, which you can use to determine next steps. For more information about `onError` event for `ignition.errored`  you can refer to [Ignition events](/guides/ignition-events#onerror)

For example, `ignition.errored` might say: “The document could not be processed by Axle. Please submit different document if available". In this case, uploading different type of document (e.g. Excel file was provided) might be necessary to successfully complete the ignition session.
