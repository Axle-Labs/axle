The Axle sandbox can be used to test your integration of Axle's API in your application or platform. All Axle API endpoints can access the [sandbox](https://docs.axle.insure/api-reference/overview#environments) environment.

<Info>
If you have not received access to the sandbox, please reach out to one of our representatives.

## Using Sandbox
- Begin the process by creating session using [Start Ignition](https://docs.axle.insure/api-reference/ignition/start-ignition) process that invokes sandbox endpoint. 
- Once an `ignition` session has been generated, select one of the test credentials to simulate different possible scenarios. These credentials can be used for any carrier listed.
- Input credentials into login page of the ignition session to complete the process. 

Congrats! Now you can access [Account](https://docs.axle.insure/api-reference/accounts/get-account) or [Policy](https://docs.axle.insure/api-reference/policies/get-policy) objects.

## Test credentials

### Simple `auto` test credentials

Following credentials will generate an **active** account with several active `auto` policies.

```
username: username
password: password
```

### Minimum `auto` test credentials

The minimum `auto` credentials will create an account with several policies, one of which has **inactive** status, and one policy which satisfies only the minimum required policy limits.

```
username: user-auto-state-minimum
password: pass-auto-state-minimum
```

### Simple `home` test credentials

Following credentials will generate an **active** account with an active `home` policy.

```
username: user-home
password: pass-home
```

### Error test credentials

Upon invoking using the following credentials, the API will return `500` with [Error](https://docs.axle.insure/api-reference/_snippets/error) response body.

```
username: user-error
password: pass-error
```
