## Testing Ignition completions in the sandbox

### Result: `link`

#### Using test credentials to complete Login

1. Once an `Ignition` session has been generated ([more details can be found here](/api-reference/ignition/start-ignition)), select one of the test credentials based on which Axle scenario you would like to test. These credentials can be used for any carrier listed.
2. Input credentials into login page to simulate connecting to an insurance account for the selected carrier.
3. If applicable, complete the Ignition session by selecting a policy that you would like to test against.

Congrats! Now you can access sample [Account](/api-reference/accounts/account) or [Policy](/api-reference/policies/policy) objects after exchanging the generated `authCode` for an `accessToken`. See our [Quickstart](/guides/quickstart) guide for more details.

#### Test credentials

**Simple `auto`**

The following credentials will connect to an account with several active `auto` policies.

```
username: username
password: password
```

**Minimum `auto`**

The following credentials will connect to an account with several `auto` policies, one of which has **inactive** status and one which satisfies only the minimum required policy coverage in most states.

```
username: user-auto-state-minimum
password: pass-auto-state-minimum
```

**Simple `home`**

The following credentials will connect to an account with several active `home` policies.

```
username: user-home
password: pass-home
```

**Error**

The following credentials will fail to connect to the Axle service, resulting in an `errored` status for the Ignition session.

```
username: user-error
password: pass-error
```

### Result: `manual`

You can complete Ignition sessions manually by selecting "My carrier is not listed" on the carrier selection page and then uploading any document of the allowed types (defaults to `pdf`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`). 

<Tip>
  Your Axle `client` will be configured in the sandbox to mirror what will be used by your application's production environment. Contact the Axle team if you would like to make any changes, such as enabling "manual" Ignition completions.

#### Sending test documents through Axle's Document AI 

If your Axle `client` is configured to used Document AI, you can use the following test documents to complete Ignition sessions and receive the expected document response. 
<Card title="Auto policy">
  <Tabs>
    <Tab title="Identification (ID) card">
      ![title](/path/image.jpg)
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Declarations page">
      ![title](/path/image.jpg)
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</Card>

<Info>
  The Axle team is currently working on providing the right sandbox experience to test Document AI. You can continue testing via the existing manual process, but stay tuned for updates!

## Testing monitoring notifications in the sandbox

After completing an Ignition session and exchanging the `authCode` for an `accessToken`, you can trigger an Account event through [`POST /sandbox/account/{accountId}/event`](/api-reference/sandbox/trigger-account-event) or Policy event through [`POST /sandbox/policies/{policyId}/event`](/api-reference/sandbox/trigger-policy-event). 

The following Account and Policy events are supported:
- account.modified
- account.disconnected
- policy.modified

<Tip>
  You can also test notifications sent to other communication channels such as email or Slack by making a request to the same Axle API routes. Reach out to the Axle team to ensure your `client` is properly configured!
