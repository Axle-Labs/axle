title: "Policy events"
description: "This guide will walk you through the various Policy events that may occur when monitoring an insurance policy."
---

Once an insurance policy is connected through an Ignition session, Axle can monitor that policy for updates. These updates will trigger events that are sent from Axle to your systems via webhook or to your organization via communication channels such as email.

<Info>
  Policy events are only sent for insurance policies connected through Axle
  Ignition sessions that are configured with `monitoring` enabled. Please
  contact the Axle team if you would like to enable this feature!

## Webhooks

<Tip>
  You must specify a `webhookUri` when generating an Ignition token to receive
  webhook events. See [Start Ignition](/api-reference/ignition/start-ignition)
  for more details.
</Tip>

A `POST` request will be sent to the `webhookUri` with the following body. All events will include `client`, `ref` (Policy object identifier), `user` (optionally specified when generating Ignition token), and `metadata` (optionally specified when generating Ignition token).

```json Example webhook request body
{
  "id": "<event_id>",
  "type": "policy.modified",
  "data": {
    "client": "<client-id>",
    "ref": "pol_Z4ni-JHBvkn9PlKJHPEwk",
    "user": {},
    "metadata": {},
    ...{ parameters }
  },
  "createdAt": "2022-10-05T14:48:00.000Z"
}
```

### policy.modified

When elements on the insurance policy are updated (see [Policy](/api-reference/policies/policy) for more details).

```json Additional data parameters (example)
{
  "changes": [
    {
      "type": "UPDATE",
      "key": "isActive",
      "value": false,
      "oldValue": true
    }
  ]
}
```
