description: "Axle's powerful API makes it easy for you to quickly retrieve detailed
information from your users' insurance policies. Here at Axle, we're champions for consumer data control and privacy, so you'll need to gain consent from the user to access their information."
---

This is where Ignition - Axle's consumer facing consent widget - comes into
play. This guide will walk you through setting up Ignition, obtaining access
tokens, and making API requests against the Axle API.

#### How it works

Axle provides a consistent, single point integration to connect
your users' insurance accounts to your application. To do so, Axle closely
follows the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow which begins when your user wants
to connect their insurance account to your application.

<Warning>
  Never send requests from your application's client to the Axle API. Generating
  an Ignition token from your application's protected services will avoid
  exposing your Axle API credentials.
</Warning>

### Step 1: Generate an Ignition token

Make a `POST` request to `/ignition`. In return, you'll retrieve an ignitionToken which
you'll need to pass to your application's client. This token will be used to initialize
Ignition and allows us to create secure, trackable session with your user.

```bash Request Sample: cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.axle.insure/ignition \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-client-id: cli_mZj6YGXhQyQnccN97aXbq' \
  --header 'x-client-secret: RZM-5BErZuChKqycbCS1O' \
  --data '{
  "redirectUri": "https://example.com/insurance/success",
  "webhookUri": "https://example.com/webhook"
}'
```

<Info>
  You can specify fields when generating an Ignition token to handle Ignition
  events (see our guide on [Ignition events](/guides/ignition-events) for more
  details) as well as attach user information or other metadata (see [Start
  Ignition](/api-reference/ignition/start-ignition) for more details).
</Info>

```json Response Example
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "ignitionToken": "ign_ur7EPeAa0km4wRlDrPJ4Z",
    "ignitionUri": "https://ignition.axle.insure/?token=ign_ur7EPeAa0km4wRlDrPJ4Z"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Initialize Ignition

Next, construct an Axle Ignition authorization URL using
`https://ignition.axle.insure/?token={ignitionToken}` for production and
`https://ignition.sandbox.axle.insure/?token={ignitionToken}` for development.

Now that you've constructed an Axle authorization URL you can open an Ignition
authentication session for the user to link their account:

- On iOS, we suggest leveraging Apple's natively supported `ASWebAuthentication`
  session ([full documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/authenticating_a_user_through_a_web_service))
- On Android, we suggest using `Chrome Custom Tabs` ([full documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/integration-guide/)) to create an in-app session and Android App Links ([full documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links)) to deep-link back into your application.
- On web, we suggest simply directing the user to the Axle Ignition authorization URL in a new window and
  setting up a route to handle the redirection parameters, or initialize the session within an iframe modal and listen for Window `MessageEvent` using `window.addEventListener`. See our guide on [Ignition events](/guides/ignition-events) for more details.

**Congrats!**

At this stage the user will now be able to securely connect their insurance account
to Axle ðŸŽ‰.

### Step 3: Exchange tokens

Once the user successfully connects their account, you'll receive an authorization
code as a query parameter at the `redirectUri` you provided in step 1 or in the body of the Window `MessageEvent`.

However, data sent by a client - especially via URLs - is generally considered
insecure. That's where the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code grant comes into play.
We'll exchange the short-lived `authCode` for a long-lived `accessToken` server
side.

<Note>
  `authCodes` expire after 10 minutes so be sure you're exchanging codes in real
  time.
</Note>

To do so, make a `POST` request with your `authCode` to `token/exchange`. In
return you'll receive an `accessToken` and an `accountId`.

```bash Request Sample: cURL
curl --request POST \
--url https://api.axle.insure/token/exchange \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-client-id: cli_mZj6YGXhQyQnccN97aXbq' \
--header 'x-client-secret: RZM-5BErZuChKqycbCS1O' \
--data '{
"authCode": "cod_LGUgD5ZnqWy3pThdOLUsT"
}'
```

```json Response Example
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "account": "acc_gM2wn_gaqUv76ZljeVXOv",
    "policies": ["pol_CbxGmGWnp9bGAFCC-eod2"],
    "accessToken": "tok_IwShXCT_JPr6rmtiCVxcQ"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Store access credentials

Store the `accessToken` and `accountId` received in step 4 in your database -
they'll be used to access account and policy information for the user going
forward.

<Check>
**Congrats!**

You have now received an accessToken that represents consent from the user and
can now leverage the Axle API to access their insurance data ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰!

</Check>

### Step 5: Retrieve the Account

Now that we have an `accessToken`, we can retrieve the Account object for the
user's connected account by making a `GET` request to `accounts/{id}` with
the `accessToken` passed in the `x-access-token` header. By passing the `expand` parameter, we can also can retrieve all Policy objects available on the account:

```bash Request Sample: cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.axle.insure/accounts/acc_gM2wn_gaqUv76ZljeVXOv?expand=true \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-access-token: tok_IwShXCT_JPr6rmtiCVxcQ' \
  --header 'x-client-id: cli_mZj6YGXhQyQnccN97aXbq' \
  --header 'x-client-secret: RZM-5BErZuChKqycbCS1O'
```
